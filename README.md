### The challenge
The challenge is to build out this [Rock, Paper, Scissors game](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Maintain the state of the score after refreshing the browser
- **Bonus**: Play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock against the computer _(optional)_

Additional features added by me:
- Switch between the two difficulty modes (easy / hard)
- Reset the score of the currently active difficulty mode
- Music and volume toggles
- Animation of various elements

I don't have access to the premium Figma/Sketch files, so the design is not pixel perfect.
